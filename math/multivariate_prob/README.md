# Multivariate Probability

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding multivariate probability distributions, particularly the multivariate Gaussian distribution, covariance, and correlation. Through practical implementation using Python and numpy, we aim to grasp essential concepts and techniques related to analyzing multivariate data.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain who Carl Friedrich Gauss was and his contributions to mathematics and statistics.
- Define and understand the concept of joint/multivariate distribution.
- Understand the meaning and significance of covariance and correlation coefficient in statistics.
- Define and compute covariance matrix for a set of variables.
- Explain the concept of multivariate Gaussian distribution and its application in modeling multivariate data.

## Tasks
- Implement functions to calculate mean, covariance, correlation coefficient, and covariance matrix using Python and numpy.
- Understand and analyze datasets using multivariate statistical techniques.
- Explore practical applications of multivariate probability distributions in various domains.

Through these tasks, we aim to deepen our understanding of multivariate probability and its practical implications in data analysis and modeling.
